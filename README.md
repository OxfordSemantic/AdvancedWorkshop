# RDFox Advanced Reasoning Workshop

Welcome to the RDFox Advanced Reasoning Workshop!

In this workshop you will learn how to:
- write, debug and optimise advanced rules using all of RDFox's features for faster reasoning performance,
- manipulate sets of rule to take advantage of the most advanced functionality of reasoning,
- tips and tricks to improve your ability and understanding of reasoning with RDFox.

There are 3 main sections:

0. Setup & help

1. Foundations

2. Rule keywords and functions

3. Advanced use of rules

Contained within each notebook is:
- a simple example of a complex concept with details explanations of each part,
- a challenging rule-writing exercise,
- real world applications that are enabled by the kind of reasoning described.

## How to use the workshop material

1. Open the `AdvancedWorkshop` folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Start RDFox using the `start.rdfox` script from the `AdvancedWorkshop` working directory.

- Instructions can be found in `0-StartRDFox`.`

3. Copy and paste the commands given in the exercises into the active RDFox terminal.

4. Some files called `incompleteRules.dlog` contain missing parts (using `___` as a placeholder) and require you to complete them to continue - they are clearly marked along the way.

5. If you get stuck, take a look at the `solution.dlog` file in the corresponding `exercise` folder.

## Useful tips & tricks

1. Get the [RDFox VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rdfox.rdfox-rdf) for syntax highlighting and in-IDE features.

2. When completing an exercise, split your editors viewport between the explanation and the relevant rule file.
